Faasos SQL Project

Problem Statement:-

This project simulates the database of a food delivery service, focusing on streamlining data management for ingredients, rolls, recipes, and drivers. The goal is to provide actionable insights into operations and optimize food preparation and delivery processes using advanced SQL techniques.

Objectives:-

Design and implement a structured database for managing food delivery service data.
Populate the database with realistic sample data.
Execute complex queries to derive insights for:
Identifying roll ingredients and recipes.
Tracking driver registrations and assignments.
Analyzing data trends for operational improvements.
Showcase proficiency in advanced SQL concepts and database management.

Dataset Overview:-

The database consists of the following tables:

driver: Stores driver IDs and their registration dates.
ingredients: Lists all available ingredients and their unique IDs.
rolls: Represents roll types (e.g., Veg Roll, Non-Veg Roll).
rolls_recipes: Maps rolls to their respective ingredients.
Sample Data:

Drivers: Includes IDs and registration dates (e.g., January 2021 to August 2021).
Ingredients: Ingredients like BBQ Chicken, Cheese, and Tomato Sauce.
Rolls: Types include Veg and Non-Veg Rolls.
Recipes: Ingredients linked to roll types (e.g., Veg Roll uses Cheese and Mushrooms).

Skills Showcased:-

Database Design: Created normalized schemas to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency.
SQL Programming: Wrote complex queries for data retrieval and analysis.
Data Insertion: Populated tables with relevant and structured sample data.
Data Analysis: Performed joins, aggregations, and filtering to derive business insights.
Optimization: Used indexing and efficient data structures for performance improvement.

Key Insights:-

Ingredient Usage Analysis:

Identified the most frequently used ingredients in roll recipes.
Determined potential shortages in ingredient stock based on recipe demand.
Driver Activity:

Analyzed registration trends to optimize driver hiring.
Mapped driver activity to operational periods for better resource planning.
Menu Trends:

Examined roll popularity based on ingredient combinations.
Suggested new menu items by analyzing unused ingredient combinations.
Operational Efficiency:

Highlighted opportunities to streamline delivery operations through driver data.
Created relationships between tables for complex queries.
Used joins, aggregate functions, and string operations for data extraction.
Query Optimization:

Structured efficient queries for fast and accurate results.
Optimized database schema for better performance.
